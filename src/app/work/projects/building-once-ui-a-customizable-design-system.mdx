## Overview

Development of a flexible and highly customizable design system using Next.js for front-end and Figma for design collaboration.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable UI components using React and styled-components in Next.js, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Theming and Customization**: Integrated a theming system that allows easy switching and customization of color palettes, typography, and layout styles using CSS variables and Figma tokens.
- **Figma Integration**: Collaborated closely with designers by setting up a shared design library in Figma. This library was synchronized with the codebase, ensuring design handoffs were seamless and that design tokens remained consistent across both platforms.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation with Storybook to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **Storybook**: For building an interactive, documented component library.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was balancing the need for flexibility with the desire to maintain design consistency. The solution involved creating well-defined design tokens and establishing clear guidelines for when and how components could be customized. Additionally, setting up effective collaboration workflows between designers and developers using Figma and Git was a learning experience that greatly improved the process.

## Outcome

The design system is now actively used across multiple projects, leading to faster development cycles, fewer design inconsistencies, and improved collaboration between design and development teams. It has become a foundation for scaling our products efficiently while ensuring a cohesive user experience.
